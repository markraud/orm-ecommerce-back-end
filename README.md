## Installation

Create the database using MySQL "CREATE DATABASE ecommerce_db;". Run 'npm run seed' from the terminal. Start the application by running 'npm start' from the terminal.

## Usage

Run 'npm start' from the terminal. This is a script that will run 'node server.js'. You should see 'App listening on port 3001!'. See video for usage demonstration.

NOTE\*\*\* The product put route that was provided in the develop folder is throwing an error in Insomnia but it completes the update to the database. I'm not sure why there is an error.
